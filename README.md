<h2>WATTchers App</h2>
<h5><em>Quick intro the WATTcher is power consumption management system that me and friends developed as part of a Energy Hackahton we particapted in.</em></h5>
<h4>This app was what I created for a presentation our team had at the Alberta Power Industry Constrium forum 2024. The app was developed in react-native and was used to demo how the app might look to users who are using the WATTcher</h4>
