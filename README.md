<h2>WATTchers App</h2>
<h5><em>Quick intro the WATTcher is power consumption management system that me and friends developed as part of a Energy Hackahton we particapted in.</em></h5>
<h4>This app was what I created for a presentation our team had at the Alberta Power Industry Constrium forum 2024. The app was developed in react-native and was used to demo how the app might look to users who are using the WATTcher. The app was developed for IOS and Android using the Expo go app. This allowed me to visualize on my iPhone and then I used Android Studio to emulate a Google Pixel 8</h4>
